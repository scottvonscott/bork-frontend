# Bork

Bork was built using React as a frontend and Rails as an API for the backend data persistence. This application also uses React-Redux, React-Router-DOM, and React-thunk. 

## Description

Bork is a roshambo style dungeon game where you'll progress through levels defeating monsters and collecting loot until you reach the end and save your lost puppy.
